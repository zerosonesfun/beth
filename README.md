# Beth

A custom BBCode used at Poetic Post (poeticpost.com). This adds some bare minimum code needed to ensure that the BBCode `[beth][/beth]` changes font into a nice handwritten cursive font.

FYI: This is here for free, but this extension alone will not work for you because it does not install the font itself. Font and CSS are added separately.
