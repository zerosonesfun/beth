# Beth

A custom BBCode used at Poetic Post (poeticpost.com). This adds some bare minimum code needed to ensure that the BBCode `[beth][/beth]` changes font into a nice handwritten cursive font.

FYI: This is here for free, but this extension alone will not work for you because it does not install the font itself. Font and CSS are added separately. If you need a custom BBCode like this for that does include all necessary files you can try getting in touch with me via wilcosky.com. No promises that I'll have time though.
